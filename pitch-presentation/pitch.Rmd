## **Introduction**

This Shiny application shows a bar char of the number of Deaths in Virginia in 1940.

The user select a Population Group (Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male, Urban Female) from the dropdown menu.

The app then shows a bar chart with corresponding Age Group: 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74

The deployed application can be found at:

## **Data**

This app uses the `VADeaths` dataset in the `datasets` package. `VADeaths` stores the Death Rates per 1000 population of Virginia in 1940. They are cross-classified by age group (rows) and population group (columns).

```{r data}
library(datasets)
summary(VADeaths)
```

## **Working**

* The user selects a Population Group from the dropdown menu.

* The bar char is automatically generated accordingly

* The bar chart is automatically refreshed each time when a new selection is made.

## **Demo**

When user selects "Urban Male" option from the dropdown menu.

```{r demo, echo=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
colors <- brewer.pal(5, "Set2")

barplot(VADeaths[,3],
        main="Urban Male",
        ylab="Death Rate per 1000 population",
        xlab="Age Group",
        col=colors)
```
